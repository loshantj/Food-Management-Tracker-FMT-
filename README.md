Online Food Delivery IoT System: Enhance online food delivery with GPS tracking, light intensity, and humidity sensors, ensuring food security and quality. Mitigate delivery issues, and improve customer satisfaction. Open for contributions.
Online food delivery services have become increasingly popular, but they often face common issues that can lead to customer dissatisfaction, such as food box tampering, temperature fluctuations, and delivery errors. To address these challenges and enhance the overall customer experience, this project proposes the development of an IoT (Internet of Things) solution that leverages the power of GPS, light intensity sensors, humidity sensors, and a NodeMCU microcontroller.

Features
This IoT system aims to provide the following key features:

Location Tracking: The system utilizes GPS to track the exact location of the food delivery vehicle, ensuring the food reaches the correct destination.

Security Monitoring: A light-intensity sensor is employed to detect any unauthorized opening of the food box during transit, alerting both the delivery personnel and the customer.

Temperature Control: The system incorporates temperature sensors to monitor and control the temperature inside the food box, ensuring that the food is delivered at the optimal temperature.

Humidity Management: Humidity sensors are used to track and maintain the ideal humidity level inside the food box to prevent food spoilage.

Real-time Alerts: In the event of any issues, such as box tampering or temperature deviations, the system can send real-time alerts to both the delivery personnel and the customer via a mobile app or SMS.

Data Analytics: The collected data can be analyzed to identify trends and improve the delivery process, leading to enhanced customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
